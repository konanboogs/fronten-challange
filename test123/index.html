					"How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" <br />
					You've already gone through the hardes parts being a <br />
					developer, it's time to elevate your skills and became a leader <br />
					in something you're passionate about.
					<br /><br /><br />
					I'm happy to chat over coffe some time about how I can help your
					company.
